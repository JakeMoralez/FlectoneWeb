### `Placeholders`

You can use all the placeholders that are used in the initial Minecraft message
::: tip EXAMPLE FOR A BLOCK MESSAGE
There is a placeholder `<reason>`, so I can use `<reason>` inside Twitch messages
:::

There are also placeholders that WILL DEFINITELY be replaced in any message
- `<final_message>` the message sent to Minecraft
- `<final_clear_message>` the message sent to Minecraft without Unicode emojis
- `<player>` the player’s nickname who sent the message

Obviously, all placeholders from `PlaceholderAPI` and `FlectonePulse` will also work

### `for-minecraft`
- By default `<fcolor:2><name> <fcolor:1>» <fcolor:4><message>`

The format of the message that will be sent from Twitch to Minecraft

### `message-channel`

A list of messages with the format of the final message

::: tip IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANOTHER MESSAGE:
1. Take the name from the list of `message types`
2. Insert into `message-channel`
```yaml
message_name: "<final_message>"
```

### `message-channel`

A list of message types and Twitch channel names

::: tip For example, I want to send a `/ban` command message from Minecraft to Twitch
1. Copy the names of the Twitch channels to send the message to (`faseri4ka`)
2. Write:
```yaml
message-channel:
  COMMAND_BAN:
    - "faseri4ka" // [!code highlight]
```

There can be any number of channels, as long as the connected account has access to them
:::

### `follow-channel`

A list where the key is the channel name, and the value is a list of commands to be executed when the stream starts

::: tip For example, I want to track the stream start for `faseri4ka` and write `stream start https://twitch.tv/faseri4ka`
1. Copy the channel name `faseri4ka`
2. Write:
```yaml
follow-channel:
  faseri4ka:
    - "stream start https://twitch.tv/faseri4ka"
```

- Up to 10 channels can be tracked at once, as long as the connected account has access to them
- There can be any number of commands to be executed when the stream starts
